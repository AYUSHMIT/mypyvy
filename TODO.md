- check epr graph
- switch to POD representation of expressions -- i hate oop
- inductive generalization
- model minimization?
- phase automata
- support functions
- somehow use heuristic "first frame that contains no initial condition"
- implement smarter unsat core minimization using binary search
- generalization heuristic: eliminate mutable conjuncts first
- generalization optimization: conjecture that an entire relation is irrelevant
- refactor diagram to remember more structure in conjuncts -- group by decl
